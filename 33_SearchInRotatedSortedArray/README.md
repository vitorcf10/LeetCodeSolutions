_Time Complexity:_ O(logn), the problem at each iteration gets halved, just like in a binary search, therefore O(logn).<br />
_Space Complexity:_ O(n), input array of size n plus constant auxiliary space.<br /><br />

**Note:** For more details on solution, please refer to its code; it is all extensively commented.
