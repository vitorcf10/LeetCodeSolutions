_Time Complexity:_ O(n), there is one for loop that iterates n times, where n is the size of the nums2 array.<br />
_Space Complexity:_ O(1), input arrays have size n+m, the auxiliary space is constant.<br /><br />

**Note:** For more details on solution, please refer to its code; it is all extensively commented.
