_Time Complexity:_ O(n*m), where n is the number of strings in input array and m is the length of the smallest string in input array.<br />
_Space Complexity:_ O(k), input string array has size n, the auxiliary space has k complexity as k is the size of the longest common prefix returned.<br /><br />

**Note:** For more details on solution, please refer to its code; it is all extensively commented.
