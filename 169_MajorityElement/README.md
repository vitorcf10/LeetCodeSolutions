Dictionary Solution<br />
_Time Complexity:_ O(n), iterates through the array once.<br />
_Space Complexity:_ O(n), if the array only has unique elements the size of the auxiliary dict is equal to size of the array.<br /><br />

Sorting Solution<br />
_Time Complexity:_ O(nlogn), cost of sorting the array.<br />
_Space Complexity:_ O(1), auxiliary space is constant.<br /><br />
